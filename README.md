This is a collection of programs illustrating the
3rd volume of the [Elegant Objects][book] book
(it's not yet published).

Each sub-directory contains a program that illustrates
a particular section in the book.
In order to run them all, install [eolang][eoc]
and then run:

```bash
make
```

This should compile them all and run all tests.
